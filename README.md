# Retrospective Writeup
How was work split between teammates? 

Work was divided into the basic groups: Board Logic (Austin Wildman and McKenna Groves), Visuals (Bunty Dey and Seth Peterson), and Communication between components (Blake Jordan). Later on, after some work was done we split it into individual tasks such as writing specific functions, documentation of specific files, etc. 

What were the challenges and how were they overcome or dealt with? 

The biggest challenge was learning TypeScript and HTML as well as the Angular Platform. That challenge was met with a lot of googling and good old trial and error. We also had some issues with GitHub and resolving merge conflicts. Sometimes if one person deleted something on their branch that had been previously pushed to master but was no longer needed, it would reappear on the master branch because there was confusion regarding whether or not it was needed. Also, one of our validators that stopped the board from crashing was accidentally deleted. 

Did any features not make the demo? 

Yes, a max validator for the rows and colums input as well as an error message if the input contained decimals. They were coded and added to the master branch before the code freeze, but were accidentally removed in a merge conflict later on. We didn't notice what had happened until demo day. Our bad! 

Is there anything your team could have done differently? 

Yes, during the beginning stages of the project, each of us did our own thing and there was no form or structure to our plan. Each member's roles were loosely defined which led to some overlap when it came to who was doing what. We discovered later on that it was much more helpful to tackle a particular problem together instead of each trying to tackle the problem separately, then just going with whatever worked first. Also, due to issues we encountered with some features being accidentally deleted, we will definitely add a last minute check to the list to make sure everything is working correctly BEFORE demo day.
